                  Team India lifts the ICC T20 World Cup 2024, ending an 11-year
                  ICC trophy drought. From dominance in the group stage to
                  composure in the final — this was a complete team performance.
                </p>
                  <p>
                 Rohit Sharma led from the front, setting the tone in the powerplay with aggressive starts. His knock against Australia was a tournament highlight. Truly a captain’s performance.
                </p>
                  <p>
                  When it mattered most, Virat delivered. Anchoring India in the final, he silenced critics with a composed, match-winning fifty. A perfect farewell to T20I greatness.
                </p>
                  <p>
                 Returning after injury, Pant showed grit and maturity. Agile behind the stumps and crucial in finishing lower-order innings, he proved his worth once again.
                </p>
                  <p>
                 Known for his fearless strokeplay, SKY’s acrobatic catch in the final became an instant classic. He kept the scoreboard ticking and electrified the field.
                </p>
                  <p>
                 Axar delivered under pressure with bat and ball. His explosive cameo in the final turned the game, and his tight overs held momentum.
                </p>
                  <p>
                 Dube played the role of finisher with brute force. His six-hitting ability gave India the edge in crunch moments during the middle and death overs.
                </p>
                  <p>
                From finishing the innings with the bat to bowling the nerve-wracking last over, Hardik was calm, focused, and deadly accurate. A true all-round star.
                </p>
                  <p>
               He might not have flashy numbers, but Jadeja’s fielding, spin control, and quick cameos made a huge difference in tight situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kuldeep’s clever wrist spin bamboozled top-order batsmen. His spell in the semifinal turned the tide and kept India in control.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arshdeep struck early in most games, delivering breakthroughs when needed. His inswingers and yorkers made him lethal in the first six.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bumrah was near-unplayable. Whether it was the powerplay or death overs, he broke partnerships and built pressure. India’s true MVP.
                </p>
                <p>Coach Dravid's silent leadership and strategic vision shaped this young squad into champions. His farewell couldn't be more perfect.</p>
                <p>Two icons of Indian cricket signed off from T20Is on the ultimate high. Their names are forever etched in history, their final act a storybook ending.</p>
